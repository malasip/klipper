                         Capture: cfs_toolchange_capture_20260520_013844.bin
                         0x10 sub-commands: 0x02/0x00 init, 0x02/0x04 poll,
                         0x02/0x05 streaming position feedback.
                         0x10 response: 1-byte motor state + 2-byte uint16 position
                         (units: 0.01mm). Motor state 0xc3=accel, 0xc4=at speed.
                         0x11: sub-command 0x02/0x01, ACK-only response.
                         0xf0 VERSION_INFO decoded: ASCII firmware version string.
                         Filament path length confirmed: ~398-400mm to toolhead.
  v1.1.1 (2026-06-03): Cross-referenced against the STOCK box_wrapper.cpython-39.so + the rest of
                         the on-board CFS stack (the project's CFS protocol notes):
                         * 3 of 5 CFS modules ship as open Python on the Hi already: auto_addr,
                           external_material (RFID reader @ addr 0x11, cmd 0x02), and steer (the CFS
                           CAMERA module @ addr 0x41, GET_STATE 0x0A heartbeat; the long-unknown
                           "0x41" device on the bus is the steer/camera, not a box).
                         * Stock box exposes ~17 BoxAction.communication_* RS485 methods. The 7
                           implemented here are confirmed identical; the other 10 are listed below
                           as CMD_*_TODO (codes are not readable in .so strings; a CFS load capture
                           via tools/capture_cfs_traffic.py is needed to fill them).
                         * A Hi-side serial_485-wired sibling of this driver lives at
                           the box module (uses the shared transport
                           instead of pyserial, since on the Hi /dev/ttyS5 is owned by serial_485).
  v1.2.0 (2026-06-19): Wire-evidenced protocol corrections from the live Hi RS-485 tool-change
                         captures (reverse-engineering/captures/cfs-re/cfs_func_code_map_2026-06-09.md
                         and cfs_toolchange_reconfirm_2026-06-19.md, both CRC-verified):
                         * CMD_GET_BOX_STATE corrected 0x08 -> 0x0A. The 0x08 code is a SEPARATE
                           command, GET_HARDWARE_STATUS (the toolhead filament-sensor read). The
                           v1.1.0 changelog's "0x0A->0x08" fix was itself wrong: on the Hi wire 0x0A
                           IS box-state and 0x0B (not 0x0A) is LOADER_TO_APP (already correct here).
                         * get_box_state() now decodes the 0x0A 4-byte state word: data[0]=0x1a class
                           byte, data[1]=lo byte (0x20 LOADED, 0x1f FEEDING). The old 0x0f/0x00/0x02
                           single-flag model never matched the 0x0A payload.
                         * extrude_process()/retrude_process() were slot-locked to T1 (hardcoded
                           0x02). They now take a 1-hot slot bitmask (T0=0x01, T1=0x02, T2=0x04,
                           T3=0x08). retrude payload is [slot, phase], phase 0x00 start then 0x01
                           running (was wrongly [sub, slot] and skipped phase 0x00). On the buffer
                           node addr 0x81 the retrude payload is a single channel byte.
                         * Added CUT_STATE (0x05, reads cut-state after the mechanical cut),
                           GET_HARDWARE_STATUS (0x08), CTRL_CONNECTION_MOTOR_ACTION (0x0F engage/
                           release, Hi uses 0x0F not the CAN binary's 0x07), and MEASURING_WHEEL
                           (0x0E; raw 4-byte word returned, numeric decode is an OPEN TODO: the
                           0x0E RX leads with 0xc5 OR 0xc4 across captures, so [tag][3-byte BE] vs
                           float32-LE is unresolved; do NOT assume a scale).
                         * CMD_CREATE_CONNECT_TODO (guessed 0x01) aliased to CMD_GET_ADDR_TABLE
                           (0xA3): the connect / get-addr-table func is 0xA3 on the wire.
                         * extrude_process() STREAM loop is now settle-based (EXTRUDE_SETTLE_THRESHOLD)
                           with a path-length timeout, replacing the fixed EXTRUDE_POLL_MAX=8 count
                           that could finalize before the filament reached the toolhead.
  v1.2.1 (2026-06-19): Second-pass wire corrections from the live 3-color print capture
                         (hi_rs485_3color_print_2026-06-19.json, CRC-clean) and the
                         cfs_toolchange_reconfirm_2026-06-19.md cross-check:
                         * SET_BOX_MODE (0x04) per-channel form wired to the slot. The 0x04 payload
                           has two wire forms: the ENTER form [mode, param] = [00 01] that brackets a
                           tool change, and a PER-CHANNEL (print-mode) form [slot_bitmask, 0x00]
                           observed 01 00 / 02 00 / 04 00 keyed to the active slot. cmd_CFS_SET_MODE
                           now takes an optional TOOL=<0-3> (maps to SLOT_BITMASKS) for the
                           per-channel form via set_box_mode_channel(); the ENTER form stays available
                           via MODE/PARAM.
                         * extrude_process() load ramp completed. The STREAM loop only issued
                           0000/0400/0500 and never the wire's 0600 (SETTLE) and 0703 (FINALIZE,
                           data byte 0x03) stages, so a real load never finished the way stock does.
                           SETTLE then FINALIZE are now issued after the STREAM loop converges or
                           times out, per the 06-09 ramp 0000/0400/0500/0600/0703. Added
                           EXTRUDE_SUB_SETTLE=0x06, EXTRUDE_SUB_FINALIZE=0x07, EXTRUDE_FINALIZE_DATA=0x03
                           and settle_ok/finalize_ok/complete keys in the result dict.
  v1.3.0 (2026-06-19): B1 mainline-acceptance blocker: serial transport rewritten from
                         blocking pyserial to a reactor-friendly, non-blocking model so it
                         NEVER blocks the Klipper reactor greenlet. The fd is opened
                         non-blocking (os.open O_NONBLOCK + raw 8N1 termios) and registered
                         with the reactor (reactor.register_fd); a read callback buffers and
                         frames incoming bytes (reusing the EXISTING framing + crc8_cfs verify)
                         and completes the pending request's reactor.completion. _send_command
                         writes the request, arms a reactor timer for the timeout, and parks the
                         caller in completion.wait() so the reactor keeps servicing the MCU
                         keepalive and other events during the wait -- this looks synchronous to
                         callers but releases the greenlet. The OS-blocking serial.read and the
                         reset_input_buffer that ran on the reactor path were removed; partial
                         reads are handled in the fd callback. A reactor.mutex() serializes the
                         half-duplex bus. The deferred auto-init (register_callback off
                         klippy:ready) is preserved; the fd is unregistered cleanly and any
                         pending waiter is aborted on klippy:disconnect/shutdown. The public
                         API of every caller (get_box_state, extrude_process incl. the
                         STREAM/SETTLE/FINALIZE sequence, retrude_process, cut_state,
                         get_hardware_status, measuring_wheel, ctrl_connection_motor_action,
                         set_box_mode, set_box_mode_channel) is UNCHANGED.
                         TARGET: a portable mainline-Klipper CFS extra on a non-Hi host with its
                         OWN dedicated serial port. It does NOT share serial_485; it keeps owning
                         its own port. serial_port is effectively REQUIRED off-Hi because the
                         CFS_DEFAULT_PORT /dev/ttyS5 is Hi-specific (on the Hi that node is owned
                         by serial_485 anyway). RS485 direction is left to an auto-direction
                         adapter by default; opt in to kernel RS485 RTS via rts_on_send.
  v1.4.0 (2026-07-05): CHOREOGRAPHY REBUILD from the hardware-validated reference stack
                         (the open box.py deployed and exercised on a real Creality Hi + CFS
                         through 2026-07-01: load, unload, flush and cut-read all verified on
                         the wire). Every post-2026-06-19 protocol decode is now ported:
                         * LOAD (0x10): the fixed 5-stage settle-based ramp is replaced by the
                           SENSOR-GATED push loop -- the 0x05 push repeats and the 0x06/0x07
                           finalize fires only after the TOOLHEAD filament switch trips, with
                           whole-cycle re-arms (fresh 0x00 init) until the switch latches, a
                           per-push wheel-advance watchdog for the box's ~3-push per-arm
                           self-limit, 15 s blocking per-stage replies (the real ready
                           mechanism; the box HOLDS each reply), and a 90 s wall budget.
                         * 0x10 push reply decode CORRECTED: the payload is a 4-byte BE
                           IEEE-754 wheel float (negative, magnitude-monotonic). The old
                           [state 0xC3/0xC4][uint16 0.01mm] model was a misparse (the 'state'
                           byte was the float's exponent byte).
                         * UNLOAD (0x11): rebuilt to the START/FINISH pair (both frames carry
                           the slot bitmask) with ONE interleaved toolhead G1 E-15 F360 pull,
                           0x08 00/01 sensor prep reads, a finish timeout covering the ~9.6 s
                           held FINISH ACK, and completion gated on the toolhead filament
                           switch clearing (the 0x11 reply status is wire-disproven as a gate
                           and is now diagnostic-only). 60 s wall budget.
                         * GET_BOX_STATE (0x0A): the request is sent EMPTY (no param byte) and
                           the loaded flag is data[3]==0x02. b0/b1 are an opaque per-firmware
                           base (0x1a20/0x1b26/0x1c24/0x1d21 all observed) and are no longer
                           decoded as state. The frame STATUS byte is surfaced as the async
                           event channel (0x30 insert push, 0x16 busy/cal).
                         * SET_PRE_LOADING (0x0D): payload generalized to [mask][phase] and the
                           INVERTED gcode mapping fixed -- arm is phase 0x00, disarm 0x01 (the
                           old ENABLE=1 sent the wire DISARM). The reply STATUS byte is now
                           checked (0x00 ACK; 0x16 NAK) and blocking phases get real timeouts
                           so the host can never hang up mid-phase and NAK-wedge the box.
                         * CUT: CFS_CUT mechanical cut ram added (switch-guard, zero-travel
                           refusal, M109 preheat, 0x05 post-check with the 0x02 nothing-to-cut
                           decode).
                         * FLUSH: CFS_FLUSH hotend purge loop added (total = nozzle_volume/2.4
                           + (5/12)*flush_volume*multiplier, 80 mm per-cycle cap, measuring-
                           wheel under-feed/clog watchdog, optional per-cycle wipe macro,
                           final 1.5 mm retract).
                         * TEMP GUARDS (critical for mainline): every hotend G1 E move is
                           preceded by a blocking M109 and a MIN_EXTRUDE_TEMP floor check
                           (mainline KEEPS the min_extrude_temp raise the Creality fork
                           deletes), and the box-motor feed -- which bypasses Klipper's
                           protection entirely -- enforces the same floor before feeding
                           toward the hotend.
                         * Slot presence reads added (0x02 READ_MATERIAL / 0x03 READ_REMAIN,
                           slot-bitmask selected) and 0x0C GET_BUFFER_STATE on the buffer node.
                         * Connect timing: after addressing, boxes get a wake-sized 12 s
                           single-shot 0x0A probe with bounded retries (the box slave-MCU
                           needs ~9.5 s after the 0xA0 assign and the first 0x0A after quiet
                           legitimately returns None), then the stock connect-init burst
                           (feed-mode, version, the two-frame pre-load self-check -- stock
                           sends NO [0f][02] -- and the all-slot presence read).
                         * get_status() added so printer["creality_cfs"] resolves in macros.
                         * T0..T3 macros fixed: tools select the SLOT BITMASK on the single
                           controller at addr 0x01 (TOOL=0..3), NOT bus addresses 1..4.
                           Multi-box daisy-chains are a separate axis from tool slots.
  v1.5.0 (2026-07-28): STOCK-FIDELITY AUDIT against the wire captures + decode corpus.
                         (Audit work dated 2026-07-19; released 2026-07-28.)
                         *** BREAKING: enter_feed_mode() lost its slot parameter and is now
                         enter_feed_mode(addr). See the bullet below. Every in-repo caller
                         already passes one argument and no gcode signature changed, so a
                         normal [creality_cfs] install is unaffected; external code calling
                         it with two arguments must drop the second. ***
                         * BROADCAST RESPONSE MATCHING fixed: a slave answers a broadcast
                           (0xFC-0xFF) from its OWN unicast address (stock capture: the
                           0xFE SET_SLAVE_ADDR is ACKed by `f7 01 11 00 a0 ...`), so
                           broadcast waiters now match on the function code alone. The old
                           strict addr-echo match dropped every discovery/assign reply on
                           real hardware and auto-addressing could never see a box.
                         * enter_feed_mode() sends the stock FIXED pair 0x04 [00][01] for
                           every slot; the [00][slot] form was an invented generalization
                           never on the wire (stock sends [00][01] before slot-2/3 retracts
                           too). Signature changed: enter_feed_mode(addr).
                         * Operational timeouts raised 0.1 s -> 2.0 s (TIMEOUT_OPERATIONAL)
                           to the stock to=2 budget for the 0x04/0x14/0x0D/0x08/0x02/0x03
                           family and 0x0A. Observed latencies (0x0A 60-125 ms steady; the
                           0x14 reply ~1.05 s late at boot) sat ABOVE the old 0.1 s, so
                           replies were clipped and retries re-sent into the half-duplex
                           bus mid-answer. Addressing-layer timeouts unchanged (stock).
                         * 0x0C GET_BUFFER_STATE request framed with STATUS 0x00, matching
                           every captured 0x0C TX (`f7 81 04 00 0c 0b`); the 0xFF form was
                           never observed on the wire.
                         * CFS_STATUS/CFS_VERSION BOX= is bounded by box_count (was a raw
                           IndexError into a Klipper internal error for BOX > box_count).
                         * FILAMENT-BUFFER RE-PIN (per the 2026-07-19 buffer spec): the
                           real buffer read is func 0x05 on the BOX (TX f7 01 03 ff 05;
                           RX byte 0 middle / 1 full / 2 empty -- enum bytecode-derived,
                           only 0x00 wire-seen on the Hi). get_buffer_state() now does
                           that read; the 0x0C-on-0x81 block read is demoted to the
                           diagnostic read_buffer_block_0x0c() (BOX-G7/U3 entanglement).
                           The old CUT_STATE decode of the same frame was a
                           misattribution of the buffer enum; cut_state_code()/
                           cut_state() are deprecated wrappers. The post-load and
                           post-cut 0x05 reads are reworded as buffer verification
                           (stock does not gate on them; neither do we).
                         * 0x0A pushed-status fault listener (gap-fill): abnormal 0x0A
                           STATUS bytes (0x50 FILAMENT_ERR runout flag, 0x51 SPEED_ERR
                           -> key846, 0x52 ENWIND_ERR -> key847) are dispatched from
                           BOTH the polled reply and unsolicited pushes; without it a
                           mid-print buffer-empty passed silently. NO periodic buffer
                           poll or host top-up loop was added: the box firmware runs
                           the feed loop internally, stock has no host loop.
                         * Flush clog watchdog: latches key845 ('the nozzle is
                           blocked', the key the stock wire raises at wheel diff 0.0;
                           was key859), and is armed only for cycles >= 2x
                           buffer_empty_len (stock gates the wheel-diff check on the
                           buffer's absorb capacity; new config key buffer_empty_len,
                           stock default 30). Unload 0x11 trigger-byte semantics
                           documented (0x00 buffer-empty-limit stop, 0x01 material-
                           sensor stop); phase failures latch key851/key849
                           (diagnostic only).
                         * Box-parity status surface (in-flight, same tree): stock-shaped
                           flat `box` status object, BOX_ENABLE_AUTO_REFILL /
                           BOX_UPDATE_SAME_MATERIAL_LIST / BOX_CHECK_MATERIAL_REFILL /
                           BOX_ERROR_CLEAR, the key831..key864 error dictionary, and
                           NOZZLE_VOLUME_DEFAULT reconciled 183 -> 108 (the stock BoxCfg
                           compiled default; 183 was the reference printer's tuned value).

Known limitations:
  - Half-duplex RS485 direction switching is left to a hardware auto-direction adapter
    by default. Opt in to the kernel RS485 RTS-as-DE mode with rts_on_send=1 (or 0 for
    RTS-low-on-send); rts_on_send=-1 (default) leaves the UART alone.
  - Serial I/O is fully non-blocking and reactor-driven (v1.3.0). A registered fd callback
    parses incoming frames; a reactor.completion delivers the matched response to the waiting
    caller, which parks in completion.wait() bounded by a reactor timer. No call blocks the
    reactor greenlet.
  - 0x05 post-cut read: the byte is the BUFFER position (v1.4.1 re-pin), not a cut
    confirmation; the cut itself is confirmed by the toolhead cutter switch. 0x00 middle
    (filament staged, historically 'cut OK') and 0x02 empty (nothing staged) are
    wire-decoded; any other value is reported and box.cut_state stays False.
  - The choreography constants (stage timings, self-limit thresholds, flush split) were
    hardware-validated on a Creality Hi + CFS v1 box. Other hosts/boxes are expected to match
    (the box firmware paces itself via the blocking replies) but have not been bench-verified.

Resolved in v1.4.0:
  - 0x0E MEASURING_WHEEL numeric decode: a 4-byte BIG-ENDIAN IEEE-754 float (negative,
    magnitude grows as filament feeds). measuring_wheel_mm() returns the decoded mm value;
    measuring_wheel() still returns the raw word for monotonic-advance checks.
Resolved in v1.2.0:
  - 0x10 STREAM poll is no longer a fixed count (superseded again in v1.4.0 by the
    sensor-gated push loop).
